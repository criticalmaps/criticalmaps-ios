# Contribution Guidelines

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1.  **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2.  **Clone** the project to your own machine
3.  **Commit** changes to your own branch. Please add your changes also to the CHANGELOG. We're following the standard of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
4.  **Push** your work back up to your fork
5.  Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

> [!NOTE]
> - Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
> - Please use the simulator specified in Fastfile ("snapshot_test" lane) to run snapshot tests
